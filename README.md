# Hi there, I'm Madhavi Palla! üëã

## About Me
I'm a passionate software developer and a master's student specializing in natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. I worked on fine-tuning large language models and developing AI-powered solutions. I am deeply interested in creating scalable, impactful applications in healthcare and technology.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning & NLP:** Fine-tuning LLaMA models, Sentiment Analysis, Hugging Face, PyTorch
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, React, Node.js
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git
- **Other:** Data Analysis, Model Deployment

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [Medical Chatbot (MedBot)](https://github.com/MadhaviPalla/Medbot)
A medical chatbot that helps users find remedies based on documents. The bot uses the LLaMA model for question-answering and provides context-aware medical responses. The system involves document processing, vector storage with FAISS, and fine-tuning models for natural language understanding.

### [Context Based Question Answering](https://github.com/MadhaviPalla/context-based-qa)
Developed a Transformer-based Question Answering tool using the T5 architecture with 11 billion parameters. Fine-tuned the model on the SQuAD dataset to enhance question answering accuracy and comprehension. Integrated advanced NLP techniques to process and analyze data from PDFs, optimizing data extraction workflows.

### [Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://github.com/MadhaviPalla/brain-tumor-segmentation)
Created a Brain Tumor Segmentation model using the UNet architecture in PyTorch, achieving a high segmentation accuracy with an IoU (Intersection over Union) score of over 85%. The model was trained on a large dataset of labeled Brain MRI images. Optimized data preprocessing and reduced segmentation time by 30% using tools like Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
